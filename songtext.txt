Yeah, I'm always down for two beers
That ain't nothing new here
It's usually what I do here, but not tonight
Yeah, we had a bad one
Way worse than the last one
Ain't no comin' back from this goodbye 

Looks like I did it again
Me and my stupid mouth
I dug myself into a hole in the wall
And I gotta drink my way out

Bartender, pour me up again
I just took a hook on my heartbreak chin
We gon' be in here all night
She ain't the only thing I'm puttin' on ice
Yeah, I need a corner with the lights turned down
I can't take a good time, cold beer crowd
It's just me, Jack, and Jim
Won't you play a little Whitley for me and my whiskey friends?
